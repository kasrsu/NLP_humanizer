Please see ourguide to authors for additional information and policies relevant to authors.  (otherwise structure at author's discretion)  Read more about our Aims & Scope and content-types in ourguide to authors. To publish inScientific Dataauthors are required to pay anarticle-processing charge (APC), regardless of the selected content-type. When submitting aData Descriptor, authors must deposit all relevant datasets in an appropriate public repository prior submission, and the completeness of these datasets will be considered during editorial evaluation and peer-review. Datasets must be made publicly available without restriction in the event that the Data Descriptor is accepted for publication (except reasonable controls related to human privacy issues or public safety - where depostion is still mandated, but with an controlled repository). Articles and Comments with data should also use a repository for related outputs as needed. Check ourdata repositories guidance, and read our fulldata deposition policies. Authors may also upload their data to figshare or to Dryad during manuscript submission (find out more here). All submissions should be clearly written, and understandable by scientists from diverse backgrounds, not just specialists. Technical jargon should be avoided as far as possible and clearly explained where its use is necessary. Titles and abstracts, in particular, should be written in language that will be readily intelligible to any scientist. We recommend that authors ask a colleague with different expertise to review the manuscript before submission, in order to identify concepts and terminology that may present difficulties for non-specialist readers. Abbreviations, particularly those that are non-standard, should also be kept to a minimum and, where unavoidable, should be defined in the text or legends at their first occurrence.Please note that as long as the key section headings for the article type and present and completed we do not place any restrictions on article formatting or layout for manuscripts in review. This is because all formatting will replaced with our house style during typsetting should the paper be accepted. For this reason, we do not require or encourage the use of article templates. Authors that require a pre-defined structure are advised to copy the headings into a blank document. Beyond typsetting and formatting, manuscripts published inScientific Dataare not subject to in-depth copy editing. Authors are responsible for procuring copy editing or language editing services for their manuscripts, either before submission, or at the revision stage, should they feel it would benefit their manuscript. Such services include those provided by our affiliatesNature Research Editing ServiceandAmerican Journal Experts. Please note that the use of such a service is at the author's own expense and in no way implies that the article will be selected for peer review or accepted for publication. Sections are described for all content types unless noted. Titles may not exceed 110 characters, including whitespaces. They should avoid the use of acronyms, abbreviations, and unnecessary punctuation where possible. Colons and parentheses are not permitted. We recommend the Abstract should not exceed 170 words. It should not include references and should succinctly describe the data and how it may be used but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. We recommend URLs for download, or other details on dataset access, are not included. Please do not use sub-headings to break the Abstract into sections. Author affiliations should provide enough detail for the author to be reached, including the department, institution and country wherever possible. Full postal addresses are not required. Affiliations should be cited in numerical order within the author list, starting with the affiliations of the first author. Email addresses should be provided for corresponding authors. If you wish to name more than one first author please use a footnote such as ""These authors contributed equally"". All other contributions should be described in the author contributions statement. We do not use other status label footnotes, such as ""Senior Author"". This section should provide an overview of the study that generated the data, as well as outlining the potential reuse value of the data. Any previous publications that used these data, in whole or in part, should be cited and briefly summarized. Introductions for Articles and Comments should provide a similar explanation of why the work was performed and any relevant prior art. The Methods section in Data Descriptors should describe any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition and any computational processing. Specific data inputs should be explicitly referenced via ourdata citation format. See our detailed guidance for providing reproducible methods descriptions inStep 5. Articles should desribe the full scientific process for how the output or study was generated. This section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and to provide an overview of the data files and their formats and any folder structure. Each external data record should be cited using ourdata citationformat. Please do not include extensive summary statistics, which should be limited to less than half a page, with 1-2 tables or figures, if required at all. Note the general expectation is that, if readers wish to scrutinise your dataset's contents, they will download and analyse it for themselves. This section should present any experiments or analyses that are needed to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported by figures and tables, as needed. 'Usage Notes' is an optional section that can be used to provide information that may assist other researchers who reuse your data. Most commonly these are additional technical notes about how to access or process the data. Please do not use this section to write a conclusions section, or similar, as we do not publish these. For all publications, a statement must be included under the subheading ""Code Availability"" indicating whether and how and custom code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section can also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset if these are not included in the Methods. Please see our policy oncode availabilityfor more information. The code availability statement should be placed at the end of the manuscript, immediately before the references.If no custom code has been used then the statement is still required in order to state this. Data Descriptors and Articles must include Acknowledgements, Authors contributions & Competing interest statements immediately before the References. Comments do not require an author contribution statement. The 'Acknowledgements' statement should contain text acknowledging non-author contributors. Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks editors or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged. The 'Author contributions' statement should briefly describe each author's contribution to the work. Please see also theNaturejournals'authorship policies. A 'Competing interests' statement is required for all papers accepted by and published inScientific Data. If there is no conflict of interest, a statement declaring this must still be included in the manuscript (e.g. ""The author(s) declare no competing interests""). Please see ourpoliciesfor more information on what may constitute a competing interest. All references should be numbered sequentially, first throughout the text, then in tables, followed by figures and, finally, boxes; that is, references that only appear in tables, figures or boxes should be last in the reference list. Only one publication is given for each number. Only papers that have been published or accepted by a named publication or recognized preprint server should be in the numbered list; preprints of accepted papers in the reference list should be submitted with the manuscript.Grant details and acknowledgments are not permitted as numbered references. Footnotes are not used. For LaTeX files, please note that references should be embedded directly within the .TEX file. Please do not use separate .bib or .bbl files. If you have created a .tex that requires these, remove the dependency and paste reference list into the .tex directly. The correct abbreviation forScientific Datais 'Sci. Data'. Scientific Datasuggests the use of the standard Nature referencing style. See the examples below for a journal article1, book2, book chapter3, preprint4, computer code5, online material6-8and government report9.In addition, we encourage the use of DOIs for all items that have them, as the easiest method for readers to find content. These may be appended to the end of any reference in URL format (https://doi.org/DOI, where DOI is the relevant number). In line with emergingindustry-wide standards for data citation, references to all datasets described or used in the manuscript should be cited in the text with a superscript number and listed in the ‘References’ section in the same manner as a conventional literature reference. An author list (formatted as above) and title for the dataset should be included in the data citation, and should reflect the author(s) and dataset title recorded at the repository. If author or title is not recorded by the repository, these should not be included in the data citation. The name of the data-hosting repository, URL to the dataset and year the data were made available are required for all data citations. We strongly encourage the use of stable persistent identifers, such as DOIs, for datasets described in the journal. These should be included in references in a URL format (https://doi.org/XXXXX, where XXXX is the DOI). Please note some repositories may require these be requested in advance. For repositories using accessions (e.g. SRA or GEO) anidentifiers.orgURL should be used where available. For first submissions, authors may choose to include just the accession number. Scientific Data staff will provide further guidance after peer-review. Please refer to the following examples of data citation for guidance: [Note]: Please note the SRP accession number should be used, if available, rather than any lower order accession number. This allows the SRA dataset to be cited via a single reference, rather than many. Manuscripts may reference figures (e.g. Figure 1), tables (e.g. Table 1), and Supplementary Information (e.g. Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary File 2, etc.). Please see the additional guidance below for submittingfigures,tablesandsupplementary information. Methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods sections. For Data Descriptors, the Methods section should describe any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (seeData RecordsandCiting Data). Authors should review the transparent methods checklist below, and ensure that their manuscript complies with any relevant points. Authors are also encouraged to searchFAIRsharing.orgfor community reporting standards that may be relevant to their specific data-type. Chemistry & materials science:Manuscripts describing chemical syntheses, or characterizing new chemicals or materials should refer to theguidance atNature Chemistry. We recommend authors do not write cover letters.All submissions that meet our technical criteria are sent for review, so there is no requirement to sell the impact or importance of the work and we do not check for this at initial assessment. Any technical notes required for the submission should be input as answers to submission questions in the following sections: For Revised Manuscripts or Appeals, a separate document is required in all cases, however this should be marked as a ""Response to Reviewers"" file on the system (which is visible to all, including reviewers), rather than ""Author Cover Letter"" (not visible to reviewers). Appeal letters should state why the previous decision should be reversed, rather than just responding to the previous reviews.  Submit⤴ Submit your manuscript and related files via ouronline system. For first submissions (i.e. not revised manuscripts), authors may submit a single PDF with integrated figures and tables – the figures may be inserted within the text at the appropriate positions, or grouped at the end. Authors should note that only the following file types should be uploaded: Supplementary Information files may also be uploaded:see further guidance here. We recommend Data Descriptors and Articles not have more than eight figures, however this is not a mandate should you deem more to be editorially crucial. In addition, a limited number of uncaptioned molecular structure graphics and numbered mathematical equations may be included if necessary. Scientific Datarequires authors to present digital images in accord with thepolicies employed by theNature-titled journals. Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to publish any figures or illustrations that are protected by copyright, including figures published elsewhere and pictures taken by professional photographers. The journal cannot publish images downloaded from the Internet without appropriate permission. Figures should be numbered separately with Arabic numerals in the order of occurrence in the text of the manuscript. Figures presenting quantitative information should include error bars where appropriate and a description of the statistical treatment of error analysis should be included in the figure legend. Figure lettering should be in a clear, sans-serif typeface (for example, Helvetica); the same typeface in the same font size should be used for all figures in a paper. Use Symbol font for Greek letters. All display items should be on a white background, and should avoid excessive boxing, unnecessary colour, spurious decorative effects (such as three-dimensional ‘skyscraper’ histograms) and highly pixelated computer drawings. The vertical axis of histograms should not be truncated to exaggerate small differences. Labelling must be of sufficient size and contrast to be readable, even after appropriate reduction. The thinnest lines in the final figure should be no smaller than one point wide. Authors will see a PDF proof that will include figures. Figures divided into parts should be labelled with a lower-case bold a, b, and so on, in the same type-size as used elsewhere in the figure. Lettering in figures should be in lower-case type, with only the first letter of each label capitalized. Units should have a single space between the number and the unit, and follow SI nomenclature (for example, ms rather than msec) or the nomenclature common to a particular field. Thousands should be separated by commas (1,000). Unusual units or abbreviations should be spelled out in full or defined in the legend. Scale bars should be used rather than magnification factors, with the length of the bar defined on the bar itself rather than in the legend. In legends, please use visual cues rather than verbal explanations such as ‘open red triangles’. Unnecessary figures should be avoided: data presented in small tables or histograms, for instance, can generally be described briefly in the text instead. Figures should not contain more than one panel unless the parts are logically connected; each panel of a multipart figure should be sized so that the whole figure can be reduced by the same amount and reproduced at the smallest size at which essential details are visible. At the initial submission stage authors may choose to upload separate figure files or to incorporate figures into the main article file, ensuring that any inserted figures are of sufficient quality to be clearly legible. When submitting a revised manuscript all figures must be uploaded as separate figure files ensuring that the image quality and formatting conforms to the specifications below. When creating and submitting final figure files, please follow the guidelines below. Failure to do so can significantly delay publication of your work. Each complete figure must be supplied as a separate file upload. Multi-part/panel figures must be prepared and arranged as a single image file (including all sub-parts; a, b, c, etc.). Please do not upload each panel individually. Authors are asked to provide figures of a sufficient resolution for final online publication, however, please do not upload figures that are excessively large. As long as the image is legible it will be suitable for peer review and publication, noting the our typesetting process will compress files to standard quality for web and pdf publication anyway. Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. Figure legends begin with a brief title sentence summarizing the purpose of the figure as a whole and continue with a short description of what is shown in each panel and an explanation of any symbols used. Legends must total no more than 350 words and may contain literature references. Any descriptions too long for the figure legend should be included in the Methods section. Please also refer to ourstatistical guidelines. Authors may provide tables within the Word document or as separate files. Legends, where needed, should be included in the Word document. We recommend Data Descriptors and Articles should no more than ten tables, but more may be allowed if needed. Tables may be of any size, but only tables that fit onto a single printed page will be included in the PDF version of the article. Due to typesetting constraints, tables that cannot be fit onto a single A4 page cannot be included in the PDF version of the article and will be hosted as Supplementary Tables. Any such tables must be labelled in the text as ‘Supplementary' tables and numbered separately from the main table list e.g. ‘Table 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1’ etc. Please note bibliographic references cannot be included within Supplementary Tables and should not be listed in the reference list, which only refers to references used in the main article file. If you do wish to formally cite information used in any supplementary file please find a means of mentioning these references on the main text. Finally, please note it may be preferable to host large tables within your repository-deposited dataset instead and avoid using supplementary files entirely (see 'Supplementary information' guidance below) – please refer to them via a data citation to the repository page if so, without the use of a Supplementary Table label.  Equations and mathematical expressions should be provided in the main text of the paper. Equations that are referred to in the text are identified by parenthetical numbers, such as (1), and are referred to in the manuscript as ‘equation (1)’. Scientific Datadiscourages authors from supplying text, figures or tables as supplementary files. As much as possible, these types of content should beincluded in the main manuscript.The main sections of the Data Descriptor manuscript, and particularly the Methods section, have no word length limits and the journal is not printed, so unless the supplementary information document would extend the length of the paper significantly (e.g. by 10 pages or more) we recommend the content is included in a single article file. Data Descriptors are designed to be focused publications: if extensive supplementary text or figures are required, authors should consider whether the manuscript might best be subdivided into multiple Data Descriptors. Similarly, any primary data files should be deposited in an appropriate public repository, rather than included as Supplementary Information.Scientific Datadoes not allow statements of ‘data not shown’. Please see ourdata deposition policies. The guidelines below detail the creation, citation and submission of Supplementary Information. Publication may be delayed if these are not followed correctly. Please note that modification of Supplementary Information after the paper is published requires a formal correction, so authors are encouraged to check their Supplementary Information carefully before submitting the final version. All data-processing steps must explain the statistical methods in detail either in the Methods or the relevant figure legend. Any special statistical code or software needed for scientists to reuse or reanalyse datasets should be discussed in the Usage Notes section of Data Descriptors. We encourage authors to make openly available any code or scripts that would help readers reproduce any data-processing steps (see ourcode availability policy). In addition,authors must ensure that the version of the data described and analysed in the Data Descriptor is permanently availableso that others can reproduce any statistical analyses. Authors are encouraged to use statistical techniques to assess and report aspects related to data quality in the Technical Validation section, but not to include any general analyses or summaries as per the scope of a Data Descriptor (encourage users to analyse it for themselves). Graphs should include clearly labelled error bars. Authors must state whether a number that follows the ± sign is a standard error (s.e.m.) or a standard deviation (s.d.). Authors must clearly explain the independence of any replicate measurements, and ‘technical replicates’ – repeated measurements on the same sample – should be clearly identified. Data Descriptors should not test new hypotheses or provide extensive interpretive analysis, and therefore should not usually contain statistical significance testing. When hypothesis-based tests must be employed, authors should state the name of the statistical test; the n value for each statistical analysis; the comparisons of interest; a justification for the use of that test (including, for example, a discussion of the normality of the data when the test is appropriate only for normal data); the alpha level for all tests, whether the tests were one-tailed or two-tailed; and the actualp-value for each test (not merely ‘significant’ or ‘p< 0.05’). It should be clear what statistical test was used to generate everyp-value. Use of the word ‘significant’ should always be accompanied by a p-value; otherwise, use ‘substantial’, ‘considerable’, etc. Multiple test correction must be used when appropriate and described in detail in the manuscript. Please also see our specific recommendations forfigure legends. Molecular structures are identified by bold Arabic numerals assigned in order of presentation in the text. Once identified in the main text or a figure, compounds may be referred to by their name, by a defined abbreviation or by the bold Arabic numeral (as long as the compound is referred to consistently as one of these three). When possible, authors should refer to chemical compounds and biomolecules using systematic nomenclature, preferablyIUPAC. Standard chemical and biological abbreviations should be used. Unconventional or specialist abbreviations should be defined at their first occurrence in the text. Authors should use approved nomenclature for gene symbols, and use symbols rather than italicized full names (for example Ttn, not titin). Please consult the appropriate nomenclature databases for correct gene names and symbols. A useful resource isNCBI Gene. Approved human gene symbols are provided by HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee see alsowww.genenames.org. Approved mouse symbols are provided by The Jackson Laboratory (e-mail: nomen@informatics.jax.org); see alsowww.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen. For proposed gene names that are not already approved, please submit the gene symbols to the appropriate nomenclature committees as soon as possible, as these must be deposited and approved before publication of an article. Avoid listing multiple names of genes (or proteins) separated by a slash, as in ‘Oct4/Pou5f1’, as this is ambiguous (it could mean a ratio, a complex, alternative names or different subunits). Use one name throughout and include the other at first mention: ‘Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1)’. Note these are instructions are only required revised manuscripts, where we require an editable version in preparation for typesetting. Articles submitted for first round peer review may be supplied in pdf format (read only) for simplicity. For revised manuscripts, the core requirement is to supplya single .TEX file marked as an ""Article"" on the system. This should bestandalone, meaning it can be compiled to a pdf without any additional .bib files, style sheets, or other dependencies. To check this, please open the .TEX within your editor without providing read access to any other files. If it fails to compile, or sections are missing, please check to ensure it is truly standalone and no dependencies are required. If that has been checked, uploading the .TEX file to our submission system (as an ""Article"") without other files should allow a full full merged pdf to be generated. Note the most common issue is the the reference list is missing due to a reliance on a separate .bib/bbl. Please copy the reference list from the .bbl file, paste it into the main manuscript .tex file, and delete the associated \bibliography{sample} command. Please do not compile your own pdf and upload it to system as we then have no guarentee the files will match, or comfirmation there are no errors in the .tex. Similarly, .zip files of associated files should also not be uploaded as the .tex file should be possible to compile to a complete, viable pdf without the requirement for additional files. We do not provide, suggest or recommend the use of a LaTeX templateso if you find a previous or legacy version of this please do not use it as it may be out of date. Please do not use the LaTeX template for any other journal. The only formatting requirement are the headings listed in section 1, so copying these into a blank document and using any legible formatting stype is acceptable for first and revised submissions. We recommend Computer Modern fonts. Non-standard fonts should be avoided. For the inclusion of graphics, we recommend graphicx.sty. Please use numerical references only for citations, and include the references within the manuscript file itself as explained. Exact reference formats are not important as long as these contain all the key information (a name, a title, a journal, and - most importantly - a DOI). ​A consortium author is the name of a group, rather than an individual, in the author list. These should only be used if a standard author list, naming all contributors directly in the paper, would be considered excessively long (e..g 100 or more people). Conortia authorships should not be used for small groups that could easily be accomodating into the main list, or for advertising or promoting projects.If a consortium is included in the main author list, all members of the consortium are considered bona fide authors, and must be listed together with their affiliations at the end of the Author Contributions statement. The authors and affiliations for the consortium members are an extension of the main author list, used simply because there is no space for them at the start of the paper. Therefore any affiliations already included in the main author list should not be repeated in the Author Contributions statement and the numbering of the affiliations in the consortium should continue in numerical order from those in the main author list – they should not start again from 1. If a member of the consortium already appears as an individual name in the main author list, then his/her affiliations should be identical in the consortium author list. The consortia itself should be acknowledged with the footnote ""A full list of members appears in the Author Contributions"". If you need to give credit to a consortium, a project or a group of people who do not meet authorship criteria, you can add a mention in the Acknowledgements section or elsewhere (in which case, a full list of members can be provided as a Supplementary Note in the Supplementary Information, if desired). Please do not use consortia authorship to credit individuals who have not actively participatrf in the creation of the paper or new dataset. If you submitting a description of a secondary dataset compiled from previously published input data then authorship should not be typically granted to the data owner unless they have been actively involved in the (new) processing or compilation to create the secondary output. Instead, individuals should be credited via formal citation of the existing dataset, paper, or any other relevant works, in the same way as using any piece of prior art.

Read this blog to learn the steps to build a project report on data science, the main components to include, and a few best practices to keep in mind while creating it. Build an Image Segmentation Model using Amazon SageMaker Downloadable solution code | Explanatory videos | Tech Support Businesses worldwide use data science to address various challenges, from credit card fraud detection to image classification. Also, there will be roughly11.5 million job openings in the data science field by 2026, which offers a vast array of opportunities for data science experts. Early career professionals, however, require more than a solid theoretical background to secure ajob in data science. Businesses are seekingdata scientistswith practical experience solving data science projects that address real-world issues. A crucial step in gaining such experiences is preparing a data science project report that offers a detailed overview of the project solution. But, what does a project report on data science include? What are the steps to prepare such reports? Let us first understand what a project report on data science means, and then check out the steps that will help you design one!    A data science project report is a textual document that includes all facts, analysis, and insights related to the proposeddata science project. It is a manual for all processes necessary to achieve the intended outcomes. A project report on data science outlines the goals and objectives of the data-driven business plan of action. It is a document that helps turn a business idea into a successful venture without disruption or complexity by defining project execution strategies. New Projects Following are the six fundamental steps you must take while creating any data science project report.  You must findtopics for your data science projectbefore beginning the documentation. The first step is, therefore, to introduce the subject of your data science project. Also, don’t forget to convey the problem statement when presenting the topic in your data science project report. The second step is to describe how you plan to solve the problem. Ensure that you are familiar with the problem statement. Write about your strategy for resolving the issue after analyzing the problem statement. Your strategy is nothing more than how you intend to address the problem. The next step is presenting thedatasetyou will use for your project. Here, you must describe where you did you find the data. Mention the source URL of the website from which you downloaded it. Mention the website and the tools used to get the data if you obtained it from a website usingweb scraping. Discuss the characteristics of your dataset after presenting it within the project documentation. Ameeruddin   Mohammed ETL (Abintio) developer at IBM Gautam Vermani Data Consultant at Confidential Not sure what you are looking for? Typically, you create your project documentation when the project is complete. You will therefore find it simple to outline the layout of your project. Here, you must describe the exact steps you took to address the problem in your project. It is an essential step in preparing a project report on data science. For this step, you must: explain each data analysis process in the project, anydata visualizationspresent in the project, your reasons for choosing certain features over others, and your approach for each step of the project. The final step is to wrap up your project documentation by outlining the overall conclusions from the analysis you conduct to solve the problem. Ensure everything you say in your conclusion follows the analysis and research for your data science project. Let us discuss how you can incorporate the above steps into preparing a sample data science project report on ‘Fake News Classification.’  For this project, you need to introduce the project title/topic as ‘Fake News Classification.’ Following the project topic, you must add a brief section such as an abstract or introduction that includes the project overview and the problem statement. In this case, the problem statement is the increasing number of fake news articles worldwide and their impact on people's lives. This section also briefly explores how the mass circulation of misleading news can harm people's lives and the entire society and how the absence of credible fact-checking mechanisms is highly alarming. Add a section defining the ‘scope’ of the project. In this case, talk about how this project aims to solve the text classification problem by applyingNatural Language Processing(NLP) tools and techniquesto detect and classify fake news articles. Furthermore, give a brief overview of what kind of strategy the data science workflow involves. Mention the different steps in this fake newsclassification project. Loading the essential libraries and then loading and reading the dataset. Visualizing the dataset using charts, graphs, etc., to understand the data better. Pre-processing the datausing variousdata cleaningand manipulation techniques. Identifying the best parameters for theclassification modelsusing hyperparameter tuning. Applying multiplemachine learning algorithmsto train the models and evaluate their performance using different metrics. Firstly you need to mention the name of the dataset used in the project and the source link for the dataset. For instance, mention the name of any fake news dataset available on open-source platforms like Kaggle or Github. Talk about the dataset in detail, such as how many rows and columns it consists of, the total number of records in it, the different data types available in it, the relation between the rows and columns of data, and various categories of data, etc. Furthermore, you need to mention the attributes within the dataset. For the fake news dataset, you can mention the multiple features such as author, spam_score, type, text, like, comment, shares, language, etc. The next step involves defining all the approaches, tools, and techniques used in the project. In the case of a Fake News Classification project report, you should mention all the various methods that help in data pre-processing and then add the ML algorithms for training the classification models. The approach for data pre-processing will includefeature engineering, handling missing values, correcting data imbalances, methods like Stemming and TF-IDF for text standardization and processing, etc. You can also add theML NLP modelsused in the project, such asLogistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost. This step entails providing a detailed overview of the various processes in the project solution. For the sample project report on Fake News Classification, You can discuss how to build a model pipeline using the imblearn package, how to upsample using the fit() method, and how to oversample using the SMOTE technique. As evaluation metrics, you can also discuss macro-averages usage for each class's precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy score, and hamming loss. Lastly, you can discuss using Label Encoder to encrypt the output labels before turning the dataframe to an XGBoost Dmatrix object and fitting the model. Don't forget to highlight using the Bayesian Optimization approach for tuning the hyperparameters. A good project report must always have a proper conclusion summarizing the results. In addition, you can include a section with all the source links, references, and future improvements to your project model. Your conclusion in this sample project report should discuss the use of classification reports, confusion matrices for each class, and precision-recall-f1 curves as evaluation metrics to analyze the outcomes of your models. You can also discuss how XGBoost generalizes effectively compared to Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Looking for end to end solved data science projects? Check out ProjectPro's repository of solvedData Science Projects with Source Code! Before you start working on a report on data science project, here are a few data science project report templates and examples you can take inspiration from.  In this data science report example, you will find an overview of all three datasets from the UCI machine learning repository- German Credit Data, Credit Approval Dataset, and Credit Card Clients Dataset. There are detailed descriptions of these datasets, along with their attributes and source links. Next, it contains a section discussing all the various methods used in the project. The data splitting method splits the original datasets into 90% (train) and 10% (test) data. Also, the report discusses the various algorithms used in the project, such asNaive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc. It explains the ideal parameter settings for each of the algorithms and then presents the different ROC curves for various algorithms for each dataset. Furthermore, this data science report template describes the outcomes of confusion matrices and WEKA analysis for each algorithm and dataset. Lastly, the project report sample concludes with each algorithm's accuracy summary and performance evaluation and a few reference links. Source link for the Data Science Project Report Example-Credit Analysis Project This data science report template begins with an introduction to the project as ‘business understanding,’ which defines the problem statement, dataset description, project scope, and project plans. The section mainly explains how the project aims to develop a binary classification machine learning model to predict if an individual's income is above $50,000 or not. It further mentions that the project uses the 1994 US Census dataset from the UCI ML Repository, which contains census and income data for about 50,000 individuals. Additionally, it states that the project usesAzureMachine Learning's Team Data Science Process (TDSP) template and evaluates the performance of the machine learning models on the test set. The following section in this project report sample discusses the dataset in detail and provides the download link. It explores the total number of actual instances in the dataset, the target variables, and the various features in the dataset, such as gender, age, income, etc. The report further explains all the differentmodelingtechniques (such as feature engineering), model training, and evaluation methods. Lastly, it discusses how the model (Random Forest model) deployment takes place using Azure Container Services usingAzure Machine Learningcommand-line utilities (CLI). Source link for the Data Science Project Report Example-Adult Income Classification This data analysis project report starts with a simple introduction to the business objective, i.e., enhance Bellabeat's Leaf Chakra health tracker's marketing strategy. The data report sample also describes the project's goal of analyzing customer usage data from non-Bellabeat trackers to identify significant trends and relationships. The big data project report reveals that the high-level marketing recommendations based on those key insights will be the final output. The data analytics report further explains the several datasets used in the project, including the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data and seven more datasets available on Kaggle. Next, thedata analysisreport template discusses the pre-processing steps, including checking each dataframe for missing values, standardizing the column names, deleting erroneous outliers, etc. The data analysis section of this project report sample talks about theexploratory data analysisprocess, the relation between some pairs of attributes, device usage statistics, daily activity reports, etc. The concluding section includes the key insights and observations from the project, followed by recommendations for the customers. Source link for the Data Science Project Report Example-Wellness Tracker Recommendation System Explore Categories Here are the ten main components of a data science report (data science project report format to follow) that would be delivered at the end of a data science project.  The first page or the cover page of the project report presents the project's title and the authors' names and contributors. The reader can locate the various sections of the report using a table of contents as it contains all the topics, subtopics, and other project details. A project report's abstract provides a concise summary of its contents, giving the reader a complete overview of the subject matter of the project report. Anyone who has no prior knowledge of the report can determine whether or not they are interested in it by reading the abstract. It is one of the crucial elements of a report and covers several points, such as -a quick summary of the business assets and profit contribution. -thorough explanation of the analytical opportunity and outcome. -overview of the processes, the next/final delivery date, etc. Get confident to build end-to-end projects Access to a curated library of 250+ end-to-end industry projects with solution code, videos and tech support. This section describes the project dataset (one or more) in detail. It explores all the various attributes within the dataset and the relationships between them. It lists all the various methods, techniques, and algorithms used to develop the project solution. This section deeply explores the steps involved in the project and talks about how you approach the project, the various processes that take place, etc. You need to present the outcomes of your project to the end-users clearly and concisely. This section should include all the project model evaluation metric results, accuracy scores, etc. Every project report should have a solid conclusion summarizing the project activities and results. This section covers all the achievements and drawbacks and offers suggestions for future project applications. The reference lists the books, papers, journals, manuals, etc., that help to complete the project. It should provide complete and accurate details about the sources, such as the title, author, issue, and page number. With theseData Science Projects in Python, your career is bound to reach new heights. Start working on them today! A data science project documentation sample is not subject to a single set of rules, and your document criteria will vary depending on the project, team, company, and industry. It also requires more than just writing the report for the data science project. Think broadly and ask yourself, ""What do I need to document, and why?"" You can then establish a consistent method for documenting a data science project.  You can start by following these best practices for creating a data science project report. Before creating your report, ask some questions: Who will read these reports? Why do they require this data science report? How do people prefer to read through the report? Delivering top-notch documentation is not your objective. Instead, your goal is to provide helpful modeling solutions and insights that benefit your internal stakeholders and clients. Don't let the time constraints affect the quality of your models and systems. Generally speaking, you should begin with a thorough comprehension of the initial project activities and outcome. Identify the main dependencies and potential risks in the project. A roadmap for a project outlines how each of your target deliverables will develop and fulfill your desired vision. Data documentation will be beneficial in many aspects of your project. For instance, you can troubleshoot problems during the modeling phase using the data issues, exploratory data analyses, and corrections. In addition to listing the algorithms used in the project, it's a good practice to include any techniques you explored but ultimately decided not to use. This makes it easier for you to recall your decisions in the future. Additionally, it will enable you to inform and enlighten other team members. It’s time for you to apply these guidelines to prepare data science project reports. Explore theProjectProrepository for some interestingreal-world projects in data science and big data.

https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-a-data-based-report-6e9703dcc095,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kyle Follow Towards Data Science -- 2 Listen Share AtKysowe’re building a central knowledge hub where data scientists can post reports so everyone — and we mean absolutely everyone — can learn from them and apply these insights to their respective roles across the entire organisation. We render tools used by the data team in a way that is understandable to all, thus bridging the gap between the technical stakeholders and the rest of the company. But while we provide a space for data engineers, scientists and analysts to post their reports and circulate internally, whether these reports will be turned into business actions depends on the how the generated insights are presented and communicated to readers. Any data team can create an analytics report, but not all are creating actionable reports. This article will discuss the most important objectives of any data analytics report and take you through some of our most vital tips to remember when writing up each report. The final goal of any data exploration & analysis is not to generate interesting but arbitrary information from the company’s data — it is to uncover actionable insights, communicated effectively in reports that are ready to be used around the business to take more data-informed decisions. To achieve this, there are three underlying guidelines to follow and to continuously refer back to when writing up data-based reports: Now let’s dive into the details — how to actually structure & write the final report that will be shared across the business, to be consumed by both technical and non-technical audiences alike. As with any other type of content, your reports should follow a specific structure, which will help the reader frame the report’s contents & thus facilitate an easier read. The structure should look something like: Who is your report intended for? If it’s for a sales lead, emphasise the core metrics by which their department evaluates performance. If it is for a C-level executive, it’s generally best to present the business highlights rather than pages of tables and figures. Keep in mind the reason they have requested the report & try not to stray from that reason. As mentioned already, explain clearly at the beginning what you’re article is going to be about and the data you are using. Provide some background to the topic in question if necessary & explain why you are writing the post. Determine the logical structure of your argument. Have a beginning, middle, and end. Provide a table of contents, use headings and subheadings accordingly, which gives readers an overview and will help orientate them as they read through the post — this is particularly important if your content is complex. Aim for a logical flow throughout, with appropriate sections, paragraphs, and sentences. Keep sentences short and straight-forward. It’s best to address only one concept in each paragraph, which can involve the main insight with supporting information, such that the reader’s attention is immediately focused on what is most important. Never introduce something into the conclusion that was not analysed or discussed earlier in the report. Writing a strong introduction makes it is easier to keep the report well structured. Your introduction should lay out the objective, problem definition and the methods employed. A strong introduction will also captivate the reader’s attention and entice them to read further. The facts and figures in your report should speak for themselves without the need for any exaggeration. Keep the language as clear and concise as possible. An objective style helps you keep the insights you’ve uncovered at the centre of the argument. It is always best to keep your report as clear and concise as possible. By including more information that, while useful, is unnecessary to the core objectives of the report, your most central arguments will be lost. If absolutely necessary, attach a supporting appendix, or you can even publish a series, with each report having its own core objective. There are many visualisation tools available to you. For static plotting or for very unique or customised plots, where you may need to build your own solution,matplotlibandseabornare your answers. However, if you really want to tell a story and allow the reader to immerse themselves in your analysis, interactivity is the way to go. Your two main options areBokehandplotly. Both are really powerful declarative libraries and worth considering. Regardless of the one you choose, we recommend picking the one library and sticking with it until there’s a compelling reason to switch. Altair is another (newer) declarative, lightweight, plotting library, and merits consideration. Check out its galleryhere. While Plotly has become the leader for interactive visualizations, because it stores the data for each plot generated in the user’s browser session and renders every interactive data point, it can really slow down the load time of your report if you are working with multiple plots or with a very large dataset, which negatively impacts the reader’s experience. If you are generating a lot of graphs or are working with very large datasets but wish to retain the interactivity, use Bokeh or Altair instead. Charts, graphs and tables are a great way of summarising data into easy-to-remember visuals. Try not to break-up the flow of the report with too many graphics that essentially show the same thing. Pick the chart, graph or table that best fits with the paragraph and move on to the next point. When plotting make sure to have explanatory text above or below the chart — explain to the reader what they are looking at, and walk them through the insights and conclusions drawn from each visualisation. Label everything in your graphs, including axes and colorscales. Create a legend if necessary. When writing a report that is intended to be consumed by non-technical business agents throughout the organisation, hide your code. How you generated your graphs is not important for these users, only the visuals and the insights they display are. Naturally, if you are writing a guide or a particularly technical post for your fellow data scientists and analysts, in which you are constantly referring to the code, you should show it by default. And there we have it! 10 tips to follow every time you are writing up a data-based report. A note on the conclusion — don’t just taper off at the end of the article or finish with the final point in the main body. Give the reader a quick summary of what they have learned, explain how the insights gained impact for the business and how they can apply this knowledge in their work. Be sure to also make your analysis reproducible for your fellow creators throughout the company — it’s always a good idea to follow coding best practices when developing a data science project or publishing research, including using the correct directory structure, syntax, explanatory text (or comments in the code cells), versioning, and, most importantly, making sure all relevant files and datasets are attached to the post. Have a call to action — perhaps a recommendation for extending the analysis. And finally, last but certainly not least, add an appropriate title, description, tags, and preview image. This is important for organising the team’s work on whichever curation system you are using — presentation is key. Title Photo byDustin LeeonUnsplash -- -- 2 Your home for data science and AI.

https://www.datacc.org/en/your-needs/highlighting-your-data/publier-un-data-paper-ou-et-comment/,"FR Publishing data via adata journalis an option to be considered. Initiated by the biodiversity research community in 2010, it is now encouraged by theFrench National plan for open science(topic 2). Adata paper(ordata article) is a scientific publication submitted for peer assessment. The main goal is to describe one or more data sets to make them reusable.Here is a lectureon the subject presented by Inrae in 2017. Making data available sometimes clashes with the publisher’s economic model: somedata journalsare available with a subscription, others demand high APCs (see tables below). The article features an accurate description of data sets: author, nature and format of the data set, goals and context of the research, methodology and process, date of production, context of use, etc. It does not feature any hypotheses nor conclusions. Date sets are attached to the article or are accessible from the warehouse where they have been deposited. Here is an example of adata paper. The Lyon URFIST has developed acomplete training programmefor writing and publishing a data paper. The following list features general or thematic data journals with descriptions to help you identify those likely to accept your data.

Advertisement Find out more about Scientific Data Find the right repository for your data A key source of biodiversity preservation is in theex situstorage of seed in what are known as germplasm banks (GBs). Unfortunately, wild species germplasm bank databases, often maintained by resource-limited botanical gardens, are highly disparate and capture information about their collections in a wide range of underlying data formats, storage platforms, following different standards, and with varying degrees of data accessibility. Thus, it is extremely difficult to build conservation strategies for wild species via integrating data from these GBs. Here, we envisage that the application of the FAIR Principles to wild species and crop wild relatives information, through the creation of a federated network of FAIR GB databases, would greatly facilitate cross-resource discovery and exploration, thus assisting with the design of more efficient conservation strategies for wild species, and bringing more attention to these key data providers. The release of ChatGPT has triggered global attention on artificial intelligence (AI), and AI for science is thus becoming a hot topic in the scientific community. When we think about unleashing the power of AI to accelerate scientific research, the question coming to our mind first is whether there is a continuous supply of highly available data at a sufficiently large scale. We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of hardware and software systems for motion data. This promotes findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data sharing and Open Science in human motion research. Developing Earth science data products that meet the needs of diverse users is a challenging task for both data producers and service providers, as user requirements can vary significantly and evolve over time. In this comment, we discuss several strategies to improve Earth science data products that everyone can use. Curated resources that support scientific research often go out of date or become inaccessible. This can happen for several reasons including lack of continuing funding, the departure of key personnel, or changes in institutional priorities. We introduce the Open Data, Open Code, Open Infrastructure (O3) Guidelines as an actionable road map to creating and maintaining resources that are less susceptible to such external factors and can continue to be used and maintained by the community that they serve.

Please see ourguide to authors for additional information and policies relevant to authors.  (otherwise structure at author's discretion)  Read more about our Aims & Scope and content-types in ourguide to authors. To publish inScientific Dataauthors are required to pay anarticle-processing charge (APC), regardless of the selected content-type. When submitting aData Descriptor, authors must deposit all relevant datasets in an appropriate public repository prior submission, and the completeness of these datasets will be considered during editorial evaluation and peer-review. Datasets must be made publicly available without restriction in the event that the Data Descriptor is accepted for publication (except reasonable controls related to human privacy issues or public safety - where depostion is still mandated, but with an controlled repository). Articles and Comments with data should also use a repository for related outputs as needed. Check ourdata repositories guidance, and read our fulldata deposition policies. Authors may also upload their data to figshare or to Dryad during manuscript submission (find out more here). All submissions should be clearly written, and understandable by scientists from diverse backgrounds, not just specialists. Technical jargon should be avoided as far as possible and clearly explained where its use is necessary. Titles and abstracts, in particular, should be written in language that will be readily intelligible to any scientist. We recommend that authors ask a colleague with different expertise to review the manuscript before submission, in order to identify concepts and terminology that may present difficulties for non-specialist readers. Abbreviations, particularly those that are non-standard, should also be kept to a minimum and, where unavoidable, should be defined in the text or legends at their first occurrence.Please note that as long as the key section headings for the article type and present and completed we do not place any restrictions on article formatting or layout for manuscripts in review. This is because all formatting will replaced with our house style during typsetting should the paper be accepted. For this reason, we do not require or encourage the use of article templates. Authors that require a pre-defined structure are advised to copy the headings into a blank document. Beyond typsetting and formatting, manuscripts published inScientific Dataare not subject to in-depth copy editing. Authors are responsible for procuring copy editing or language editing services for their manuscripts, either before submission, or at the revision stage, should they feel it would benefit their manuscript. Such services include those provided by our affiliatesNature Research Editing ServiceandAmerican Journal Experts. Please note that the use of such a service is at the author's own expense and in no way implies that the article will be selected for peer review or accepted for publication. Sections are described for all content types unless noted. Titles may not exceed 110 characters, including whitespaces. They should avoid the use of acronyms, abbreviations, and unnecessary punctuation where possible. Colons and parentheses are not permitted. We recommend the Abstract should not exceed 170 words. It should not include references and should succinctly describe the data and how it may be used but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. We recommend URLs for download, or other details on dataset access, are not included. Please do not use sub-headings to break the Abstract into sections. Author affiliations should provide enough detail for the author to be reached, including the department, institution and country wherever possible. Full postal addresses are not required. Affiliations should be cited in numerical order within the author list, starting with the affiliations of the first author. Email addresses should be provided for corresponding authors. If you wish to name more than one first author please use a footnote such as ""These authors contributed equally"". All other contributions should be described in the author contributions statement. We do not use other status label footnotes, such as ""Senior Author"". This section should provide an overview of the study that generated the data, as well as outlining the potential reuse value of the data. Any previous publications that used these data, in whole or in part, should be cited and briefly summarized. Introductions for Articles and Comments should provide a similar explanation of why the work was performed and any relevant prior art. The Methods section in Data Descriptors should describe any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition and any computational processing. Specific data inputs should be explicitly referenced via ourdata citation format. See our detailed guidance for providing reproducible methods descriptions inStep 5. Articles should desribe the full scientific process for how the output or study was generated. This section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and to provide an overview of the data files and their formats and any folder structure. Each external data record should be cited using ourdata citationformat. Please do not include extensive summary statistics, which should be limited to less than half a page, with 1-2 tables or figures, if required at all. Note the general expectation is that, if readers wish to scrutinise your dataset's contents, they will download and analyse it for themselves. This section should present any experiments or analyses that are needed to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported by figures and tables, as needed. 'Usage Notes' is an optional section that can be used to provide information that may assist other researchers who reuse your data. Most commonly these are additional technical notes about how to access or process the data. Please do not use this section to write a conclusions section, or similar, as we do not publish these. For all publications, a statement must be included under the subheading ""Code Availability"" indicating whether and how and custom code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section can also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset if these are not included in the Methods. Please see our policy oncode availabilityfor more information. The code availability statement should be placed at the end of the manuscript, immediately before the references.If no custom code has been used then the statement is still required in order to state this. Data Descriptors and Articles must include Acknowledgements, Authors contributions & Competing interest statements immediately before the References. Comments do not require an author contribution statement. The 'Acknowledgements' statement should contain text acknowledging non-author contributors. Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks editors or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged. The 'Author contributions' statement should briefly describe each author's contribution to the work. Please see also theNaturejournals'authorship policies. A 'Competing interests' statement is required for all papers accepted by and published inScientific Data. If there is no conflict of interest, a statement declaring this must still be included in the manuscript (e.g. ""The author(s) declare no competing interests""). Please see ourpoliciesfor more information on what may constitute a competing interest. All references should be numbered sequentially, first throughout the text, then in tables, followed by figures and, finally, boxes; that is, references that only appear in tables, figures or boxes should be last in the reference list. Only one publication is given for each number. Only papers that have been published or accepted by a named publication or recognized preprint server should be in the numbered list; preprints of accepted papers in the reference list should be submitted with the manuscript.Grant details and acknowledgments are not permitted as numbered references. Footnotes are not used. For LaTeX files, please note that references should be embedded directly within the .TEX file. Please do not use separate .bib or .bbl files. If you have created a .tex that requires these, remove the dependency and paste reference list into the .tex directly. The correct abbreviation forScientific Datais 'Sci. Data'. Scientific Datasuggests the use of the standard Nature referencing style. See the examples below for a journal article1, book2, book chapter3, preprint4, computer code5, online material6-8and government report9.In addition, we encourage the use of DOIs for all items that have them, as the easiest method for readers to find content. These may be appended to the end of any reference in URL format (https://doi.org/DOI, where DOI is the relevant number). In line with emergingindustry-wide standards for data citation, references to all datasets described or used in the manuscript should be cited in the text with a superscript number and listed in the ‘References’ section in the same manner as a conventional literature reference. An author list (formatted as above) and title for the dataset should be included in the data citation, and should reflect the author(s) and dataset title recorded at the repository. If author or title is not recorded by the repository, these should not be included in the data citation. The name of the data-hosting repository, URL to the dataset and year the data were made available are required for all data citations. We strongly encourage the use of stable persistent identifers, such as DOIs, for datasets described in the journal. These should be included in references in a URL format (https://doi.org/XXXXX, where XXXX is the DOI). Please note some repositories may require these be requested in advance. For repositories using accessions (e.g. SRA or GEO) anidentifiers.orgURL should be used where available. For first submissions, authors may choose to include just the accession number. Scientific Data staff will provide further guidance after peer-review. Please refer to the following examples of data citation for guidance: [Note]: Please note the SRP accession number should be used, if available, rather than any lower order accession number. This allows the SRA dataset to be cited via a single reference, rather than many. Manuscripts may reference figures (e.g. Figure 1), tables (e.g. Table 1), and Supplementary Information (e.g. Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary File 2, etc.). Please see the additional guidance below for submittingfigures,tablesandsupplementary information. Methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods sections. For Data Descriptors, the Methods section should describe any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (seeData RecordsandCiting Data). Authors should review the transparent methods checklist below, and ensure that their manuscript complies with any relevant points. Authors are also encouraged to searchFAIRsharing.orgfor community reporting standards that may be relevant to their specific data-type. Chemistry & materials science:Manuscripts describing chemical syntheses, or characterizing new chemicals or materials should refer to theguidance atNature Chemistry. We recommend authors do not write cover letters.All submissions that meet our technical criteria are sent for review, so there is no requirement to sell the impact or importance of the work and we do not check for this at initial assessment. Any technical notes required for the submission should be input as answers to submission questions in the following sections: For Revised Manuscripts or Appeals, a separate document is required in all cases, however this should be marked as a ""Response to Reviewers"" file on the system (which is visible to all, including reviewers), rather than ""Author Cover Letter"" (not visible to reviewers). Appeal letters should state why the previous decision should be reversed, rather than just responding to the previous reviews.  Submit⤴ Submit your manuscript and related files via ouronline system. For first submissions (i.e. not revised manuscripts), authors may submit a single PDF with integrated figures and tables – the figures may be inserted within the text at the appropriate positions, or grouped at the end. Authors should note that only the following file types should be uploaded: Supplementary Information files may also be uploaded:see further guidance here. We recommend Data Descriptors and Articles not have more than eight figures, however this is not a mandate should you deem more to be editorially crucial. In addition, a limited number of uncaptioned molecular structure graphics and numbered mathematical equations may be included if necessary. Scientific Datarequires authors to present digital images in accord with thepolicies employed by theNature-titled journals. Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to publish any figures or illustrations that are protected by copyright, including figures published elsewhere and pictures taken by professional photographers. The journal cannot publish images downloaded from the Internet without appropriate permission. Figures should be numbered separately with Arabic numerals in the order of occurrence in the text of the manuscript. Figures presenting quantitative information should include error bars where appropriate and a description of the statistical treatment of error analysis should be included in the figure legend. Figure lettering should be in a clear, sans-serif typeface (for example, Helvetica); the same typeface in the same font size should be used for all figures in a paper. Use Symbol font for Greek letters. All display items should be on a white background, and should avoid excessive boxing, unnecessary colour, spurious decorative effects (such as three-dimensional ‘skyscraper’ histograms) and highly pixelated computer drawings. The vertical axis of histograms should not be truncated to exaggerate small differences. Labelling must be of sufficient size and contrast to be readable, even after appropriate reduction. The thinnest lines in the final figure should be no smaller than one point wide. Authors will see a PDF proof that will include figures. Figures divided into parts should be labelled with a lower-case bold a, b, and so on, in the same type-size as used elsewhere in the figure. Lettering in figures should be in lower-case type, with only the first letter of each label capitalized. Units should have a single space between the number and the unit, and follow SI nomenclature (for example, ms rather than msec) or the nomenclature common to a particular field. Thousands should be separated by commas (1,000). Unusual units or abbreviations should be spelled out in full or defined in the legend. Scale bars should be used rather than magnification factors, with the length of the bar defined on the bar itself rather than in the legend. In legends, please use visual cues rather than verbal explanations such as ‘open red triangles’. Unnecessary figures should be avoided: data presented in small tables or histograms, for instance, can generally be described briefly in the text instead. Figures should not contain more than one panel unless the parts are logically connected; each panel of a multipart figure should be sized so that the whole figure can be reduced by the same amount and reproduced at the smallest size at which essential details are visible. At the initial submission stage authors may choose to upload separate figure files or to incorporate figures into the main article file, ensuring that any inserted figures are of sufficient quality to be clearly legible. When submitting a revised manuscript all figures must be uploaded as separate figure files ensuring that the image quality and formatting conforms to the specifications below. When creating and submitting final figure files, please follow the guidelines below. Failure to do so can significantly delay publication of your work. Each complete figure must be supplied as a separate file upload. Multi-part/panel figures must be prepared and arranged as a single image file (including all sub-parts; a, b, c, etc.). Please do not upload each panel individually. Authors are asked to provide figures of a sufficient resolution for final online publication, however, please do not upload figures that are excessively large. As long as the image is legible it will be suitable for peer review and publication, noting the our typesetting process will compress files to standard quality for web and pdf publication anyway. Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. Figure legends begin with a brief title sentence summarizing the purpose of the figure as a whole and continue with a short description of what is shown in each panel and an explanation of any symbols used. Legends must total no more than 350 words and may contain literature references. Any descriptions too long for the figure legend should be included in the Methods section. Please also refer to ourstatistical guidelines. Authors may provide tables within the Word document or as separate files. Legends, where needed, should be included in the Word document. We recommend Data Descriptors and Articles should no more than ten tables, but more may be allowed if needed. Tables may be of any size, but only tables that fit onto a single printed page will be included in the PDF version of the article. Due to typesetting constraints, tables that cannot be fit onto a single A4 page cannot be included in the PDF version of the article and will be hosted as Supplementary Tables. Any such tables must be labelled in the text as ‘Supplementary' tables and numbered separately from the main table list e.g. ‘Table 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1’ etc. Please note bibliographic references cannot be included within Supplementary Tables and should not be listed in the reference list, which only refers to references used in the main article file. If you do wish to formally cite information used in any supplementary file please find a means of mentioning these references on the main text. Finally, please note it may be preferable to host large tables within your repository-deposited dataset instead and avoid using supplementary files entirely (see 'Supplementary information' guidance below) – please refer to them via a data citation to the repository page if so, without the use of a Supplementary Table label.  Equations and mathematical expressions should be provided in the main text of the paper. Equations that are referred to in the text are identified by parenthetical numbers, such as (1), and are referred to in the manuscript as ‘equation (1)’. Scientific Datadiscourages authors from supplying text, figures or tables as supplementary files. As much as possible, these types of content should beincluded in the main manuscript.The main sections of the Data Descriptor manuscript, and particularly the Methods section, have no word length limits and the journal is not printed, so unless the supplementary information document would extend the length of the paper significantly (e.g. by 10 pages or more) we recommend the content is included in a single article file. Data Descriptors are designed to be focused publications: if extensive supplementary text or figures are required, authors should consider whether the manuscript might best be subdivided into multiple Data Descriptors. Similarly, any primary data files should be deposited in an appropriate public repository, rather than included as Supplementary Information.Scientific Datadoes not allow statements of ‘data not shown’. Please see ourdata deposition policies. The guidelines below detail the creation, citation and submission of Supplementary Information. Publication may be delayed if these are not followed correctly. Please note that modification of Supplementary Information after the paper is published requires a formal correction, so authors are encouraged to check their Supplementary Information carefully before submitting the final version. All data-processing steps must explain the statistical methods in detail either in the Methods or the relevant figure legend. Any special statistical code or software needed for scientists to reuse or reanalyse datasets should be discussed in the Usage Notes section of Data Descriptors. We encourage authors to make openly available any code or scripts that would help readers reproduce any data-processing steps (see ourcode availability policy). In addition,authors must ensure that the version of the data described and analysed in the Data Descriptor is permanently availableso that others can reproduce any statistical analyses. Authors are encouraged to use statistical techniques to assess and report aspects related to data quality in the Technical Validation section, but not to include any general analyses or summaries as per the scope of a Data Descriptor (encourage users to analyse it for themselves). Graphs should include clearly labelled error bars. Authors must state whether a number that follows the ± sign is a standard error (s.e.m.) or a standard deviation (s.d.). Authors must clearly explain the independence of any replicate measurements, and ‘technical replicates’ – repeated measurements on the same sample – should be clearly identified. Data Descriptors should not test new hypotheses or provide extensive interpretive analysis, and therefore should not usually contain statistical significance testing. When hypothesis-based tests must be employed, authors should state the name of the statistical test; the n value for each statistical analysis; the comparisons of interest; a justification for the use of that test (including, for example, a discussion of the normality of the data when the test is appropriate only for normal data); the alpha level for all tests, whether the tests were one-tailed or two-tailed; and the actualp-value for each test (not merely ‘significant’ or ‘p< 0.05’). It should be clear what statistical test was used to generate everyp-value. Use of the word ‘significant’ should always be accompanied by a p-value; otherwise, use ‘substantial’, ‘considerable’, etc. Multiple test correction must be used when appropriate and described in detail in the manuscript. Please also see our specific recommendations forfigure legends. Molecular structures are identified by bold Arabic numerals assigned in order of presentation in the text. Once identified in the main text or a figure, compounds may be referred to by their name, by a defined abbreviation or by the bold Arabic numeral (as long as the compound is referred to consistently as one of these three). When possible, authors should refer to chemical compounds and biomolecules using systematic nomenclature, preferablyIUPAC. Standard chemical and biological abbreviations should be used. Unconventional or specialist abbreviations should be defined at their first occurrence in the text. Authors should use approved nomenclature for gene symbols, and use symbols rather than italicized full names (for example Ttn, not titin). Please consult the appropriate nomenclature databases for correct gene names and symbols. A useful resource isNCBI Gene. Approved human gene symbols are provided by HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee see alsowww.genenames.org. Approved mouse symbols are provided by The Jackson Laboratory (e-mail: nomen@informatics.jax.org); see alsowww.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen. For proposed gene names that are not already approved, please submit the gene symbols to the appropriate nomenclature committees as soon as possible, as these must be deposited and approved before publication of an article. Avoid listing multiple names of genes (or proteins) separated by a slash, as in ‘Oct4/Pou5f1’, as this is ambiguous (it could mean a ratio, a complex, alternative names or different subunits). Use one name throughout and include the other at first mention: ‘Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1)’. Note these are instructions are only required revised manuscripts, where we require an editable version in preparation for typesetting. Articles submitted for first round peer review may be supplied in pdf format (read only) for simplicity. For revised manuscripts, the core requirement is to supplya single .TEX file marked as an ""Article"" on the system. This should bestandalone, meaning it can be compiled to a pdf without any additional .bib files, style sheets, or other dependencies. To check this, please open the .TEX within your editor without providing read access to any other files. If it fails to compile, or sections are missing, please check to ensure it is truly standalone and no dependencies are required. If that has been checked, uploading the .TEX file to our submission system (as an ""Article"") without other files should allow a full full merged pdf to be generated. Note the most common issue is the the reference list is missing due to a reliance on a separate .bib/bbl. Please copy the reference list from the .bbl file, paste it into the main manuscript .tex file, and delete the associated \bibliography{sample} command. Please do not compile your own pdf and upload it to system as we then have no guarentee the files will match, or comfirmation there are no errors in the .tex. Similarly, .zip files of associated files should also not be uploaded as the .tex file should be possible to compile to a complete, viable pdf without the requirement for additional files. We do not provide, suggest or recommend the use of a LaTeX templateso if you find a previous or legacy version of this please do not use it as it may be out of date. Please do not use the LaTeX template for any other journal. The only formatting requirement are the headings listed in section 1, so copying these into a blank document and using any legible formatting stype is acceptable for first and revised submissions. We recommend Computer Modern fonts. Non-standard fonts should be avoided. For the inclusion of graphics, we recommend graphicx.sty. Please use numerical references only for citations, and include the references within the manuscript file itself as explained. Exact reference formats are not important as long as these contain all the key information (a name, a title, a journal, and - most importantly - a DOI). ​A consortium author is the name of a group, rather than an individual, in the author list. These should only be used if a standard author list, naming all contributors directly in the paper, would be considered excessively long (e..g 100 or more people). Conortia authorships should not be used for small groups that could easily be accomodating into the main list, or for advertising or promoting projects.If a consortium is included in the main author list, all members of the consortium are considered bona fide authors, and must be listed together with their affiliations at the end of the Author Contributions statement. The authors and affiliations for the consortium members are an extension of the main author list, used simply because there is no space for them at the start of the paper. Therefore any affiliations already included in the main author list should not be repeated in the Author Contributions statement and the numbering of the affiliations in the consortium should continue in numerical order from those in the main author list – they should not start again from 1. If a member of the consortium already appears as an individual name in the main author list, then his/her affiliations should be identical in the consortium author list. The consortia itself should be acknowledged with the footnote ""A full list of members appears in the Author Contributions"". If you need to give credit to a consortium, a project or a group of people who do not meet authorship criteria, you can add a mention in the Acknowledgements section or elsewhere (in which case, a full list of members can be provided as a Supplementary Note in the Supplementary Information, if desired). Please do not use consortia authorship to credit individuals who have not actively participatrf in the creation of the paper or new dataset. If you submitting a description of a secondary dataset compiled from previously published input data then authorship should not be typically granted to the data owner unless they have been actively involved in the (new) processing or compilation to create the secondary output. Instead, individuals should be credited via formal citation of the existing dataset, paper, or any other relevant works, in the same way as using any piece of prior art.

Advertisement Find out more about Scientific Data Find the right repository for your data A key source of biodiversity preservation is in theex situstorage of seed in what are known as germplasm banks (GBs). Unfortunately, wild species germplasm bank databases, often maintained by resource-limited botanical gardens, are highly disparate and capture information about their collections in a wide range of underlying data formats, storage platforms, following different standards, and with varying degrees of data accessibility. Thus, it is extremely difficult to build conservation strategies for wild species via integrating data from these GBs. Here, we envisage that the application of the FAIR Principles to wild species and crop wild relatives information, through the creation of a federated network of FAIR GB databases, would greatly facilitate cross-resource discovery and exploration, thus assisting with the design of more efficient conservation strategies for wild species, and bringing more attention to these key data providers. The release of ChatGPT has triggered global attention on artificial intelligence (AI), and AI for science is thus becoming a hot topic in the scientific community. When we think about unleashing the power of AI to accelerate scientific research, the question coming to our mind first is whether there is a continuous supply of highly available data at a sufficiently large scale. We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of hardware and software systems for motion data. This promotes findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data sharing and Open Science in human motion research. Developing Earth science data products that meet the needs of diverse users is a challenging task for both data producers and service providers, as user requirements can vary significantly and evolve over time. In this comment, we discuss several strategies to improve Earth science data products that everyone can use. Curated resources that support scientific research often go out of date or become inaccessible. This can happen for several reasons including lack of continuing funding, the departure of key personnel, or changes in institutional priorities. We introduce the Open Data, Open Code, Open Infrastructure (O3) Guidelines as an actionable road map to creating and maintaining resources that are less susceptible to such external factors and can continue to be used and maintained by the community that they serve.

https://towardsdatascience.com/building-and-sharing-reports-at-scale-with-python-49dfdf9fa133,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Stephen O' Farrell Follow Towards Data Science -- Listen Share Reporting is crucial to the operation of any sufficiently large data-driven company, withHousingAnywhereproving no exception to this rule. We have a wide array of reports being run every day across all departments, most of which are run usingMode Analytics. While Mode is a powerful tool that fulfills the majority of our reporting needs, it (like many SaaS products) has limitations that we cannot overcome internally. To accommodate our rapid growth, we found that we would need an additional tool with increased flexibility if we wanted to level up our reporting. The Problem One of the most important aspects of reporting at HousingAnywhere is the sharing of reports on an individual city level. As an accommodation rental platform specialising in 3–12 month stays, we offer our services in multiple cities all over Europe and the teams responsible for each city need to be able to see insights specific to their city. As a result of this we have a significant number of reports that are run multiple times in succession, but for a different city each time. On a small scale this is fine, but building reports from scratch every single time is not a scalable solution. In 2021 wemore than doubled our number of Focus Cities from 15 to 32, meaning we now have 32 cities to build these reports for (with ambitions of increasing that number in the coming years). As such, our old system was proving too inefficient and costly. In one example, we found that we were paying upwards of €50 a month on Snowflake (our data warehouse)for a single report; a cost which would have increased even further when we added our new Focus Cities at the beginning of 2021. Hundreds of euro every year on data warehousing alone for just one report? It simply isn’t feasible to grow quickly with overheads like this. Building our own system would also give us full flexibility over any packages or integrations that we need to install and manage. Another problem that we ran into involved sharing our reports externally (to our shareholders, for example). We needed to be able to easily share reports with parties outside of the organisation, something which can prove tricky if a reporting system isn’t built to handle such a task. The Solution We wanted a system that could ‘cache’ the data, meaning we could run the queries once and then create as many reports as we wanted using the resulting data. This would allow us to build a large number of reports, but at a significantly reduced cost. Instead of running every query 32+ times, we run them once; reducing the load on Snowflake to a tiny fraction of what it was previously. Anytime we want to build a report, this cached data is loaded and can be filtered based on a given set of parameters. The finalised report can then be shared as a PDF to an email address, Slack channel, Google Drive folder or anywhere else with a Python implementation. It would also have to be easy to integrate with our current tech stack, so implementing it as an API made the most sense: one endpoint to trigger the queries for a report, one to trigger a run of the report itself. This would make it easy to automate the scheduling process, while also making it trivial to build a web UI capable of managing the system. It’s flexible and efficient, allowing us more options in how we build our reports. All we would need to create a report is a couple of files: It must be said that this process is less user-friendly than building a report using a traditional tool like Mode or Tableau. This increases the time it takes to create a report, making it unreasonable to consider the system a replacement for such a tool. The aim is to use them in tandem, using our inhouse system for reports that need that extra bit of TLC. The Implementation The system itself consists of a Flask API packaged inside a Docker container deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine. The majority of our tech stack is already hosted on GCP so this was the easiest method for a quick deployment. If an API call is made to run the queries for a certain report, each .sql file that corresponds to the report is gathered and run using theSnowflake connector. The results are saved locally as .csv files, which can be referenced when building the reports. To share a report, the API call includes the parameters and destination of the report, e.g. ‘send theDaily ReportforBerlinto the#team-berlinSlack channel’. The system then builds the report using these parameters and sends it to the recipient. To build the report itself, the process isn’t too complex. The data filtering is very straightforward, consisting of basic Python functions that load the .csv files from the queries and filter them using Pandas. The input parameters are in the form of a dictionary, allowing for as many filters as needed. The filtered data is saved to a dictionary of dataframes which will be used for the graphs The graphs follow a similar format: a series of Python functions that take the aforementioned dictionary, create the graphs and save these graphs as .svg images. This gives us a lot of flexibility in our choice of graphing libraries (e.g. Plotly, Matplotlib, Altair) as we can use any library that lets us save the graph to an image. Once these images are saved, they can be linked in a HTML file. To add the specific links for each, we use Jinja to fill out a basic HTML template with the images. To get the right order, we use a simple `layout.txt` file which documents the layout of the report. Here, we can add the graph names, headers, page breaks, etc. In this example, we have three graph imagesbookings_kpis.svg,bookings_bar.svg, andbookings_forecast.svgwhich are added along with a header for the section, followed by a page break. These are picked up and parsed to allowJinjato inject the corresponding HTML. Each line of the format file describes one element in the final HTML report. Once the HTML file is complete, it is then converted to a PDF usingPDFKit. From there, we can send the PDF to Slack, email, Google Drive or wherever necessary. It means we were also able to add a whitelist for external emails, giving us the opportunity to specify email addresses outside of HousingAnywhere with whom we could share reports. We schedule our reports using a very basic custom Airflow operator. Our work on Airflow has been mentioned in previous articles where we went into detail on ourWeb Scraping with Seleniumor ourCI/CD setup, it’s a tool that we use regularly so having a simple integration to connect our reporting system and Airflow is immensely helpful. It allows us to easily schedule and share reports in a clean way, without having to deviate from our current tech stack. The goal of the project was to grant the data team the ability to scale while continuing to give each city the support they need. Before the API, we struggled to efficiently build reports for 15 Focus Cities without great expense. Since we’ve deployed this system, we’ve been able to share high quality reports on a regular basis at very little cost. We can continue to provide such reports for each city, no matter how many cities we support in the coming years.

Initiated by the biodiversity research community in 2010, it is now encouraged by theFrench National plan for open science(topic 2). Adata paper(ordata article) is a scientific publication submitted for peer assessment. The main goal is to describe one or more data sets to make them reusable.Here is a lectureon the subject presented by Inrae in 2017. Making data available sometimes clashes with the publisher’s economic model: somedata journalsare available with a subscription, others demand high APCs (see tables below). The article features an accurate description of data sets: author, nature and format of the data set, goals and context of the research, methodology and process, date of production, context of use, etc. It does not feature any hypotheses nor conclusions. Date sets are attached to the article or are accessible from the warehouse where they have been deposited. Here is an example of adata paper.
