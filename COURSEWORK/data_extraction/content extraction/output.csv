And the industry is only getting bigger, according to Codecademy Data Science Domain Manager Michelle McSweeney. “We’re seeing data transform our society and everything we do, whether it’s measuring how well something performed or deciding what we’re going to do next,” she says. Data science involves leveraging data to find actionable and business-advancing insights. If you’re interested in analyzing data to figure out why things happen and find big-picture solutions to problems in our world, or you want to work withartificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning, a career in data science could be right for you. Ahead, we’ll explore seven popular roles in data science and their responsibilities, plus help you get started on your journey to landing a job in the field. Data sciencesits at the intersection of probability, statistics, math, and software engineering. It allows us to make sense of and utilize the huge amounts of data we create every day, and it’s used in virtually every industry. In finance, for example, data science helps banks identify risks and fraudulent behavior. In healthcare, data science underlies wearable tech devices (like Fitbits and insulin pumps) that monitor your health and help physicians assess and treat health conditions. And you’re probably already familiar with data science’s use in entertainment: Every time you get a suggestion from Netflix or Spotify, that’s data science at work. Here’s a look at the different types of roles and specialties within data science, and the programming languages and skills you need to pursue them. Data Scientistshelp organizations make the most of their data. Their daily tasks range from analyzing data to find insights and forecast future trends, to building machine learning models, algorithms, and applications. They also may use data to discover potential improvements and optimizations for their company’s systems and processes. A Data Scientist’s scope and specific responsibilities depend on what the company does, how the data team works together, and the questions or problems they’re trying to solve, Michelle says. Broadly speaking, “Data Scientist” is an umbrella term used to encompass four specializations: Analytics Specialists, Inference Specialists, Machine Learning Specialists, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialists. Analytics Specialist: Also known asData Analysts, Analytics Specialists collect and analyze data to find patterns, trends, and insights that help guide decision-making. Their primary tool isSQL, which is used to manage relational databases, and they also need top-tier communication anddata visualizationskills to present their findings. “If you want to make beautiful dashboards or communicate data with a story, data analytics is the place to be,” Michelle says. Analytics Specialists are the most in-demand and versatile of the Data Scientists as practically every organization creates and manages large volumes of data. Inference Specialist:Inference Specialists help businesses understand what their data is telling them to do, Michelle says. They’re responsible for finding thewhy— figuring out how specific variables influence and drive business outcomes and results. These Data Scientists mainly work withR, a programming language designed for statistical analysis, and may run hypothesis, statistical, and A/B tests. “If you’re wowed by statistics, inference is the place to be,” Michelle says. Good to know: There’s a huge demand for Inference Specialists in banking and financial institutions. Machine Learning Specialist:Machine Learning Specialists buildmachine learningmodels and algorithms, and they may also be tasked with feature engineering, tuning hyperparameters (which guide the machine learning process), and identifying users who might be at risk ofchurn. These Data Scientists usePythonfor predictive analytics and cluster analysis, and they need a solid understanding of data structures andalgorithms. “Machine Learning Specialists are at the forefront of what we’re able to do with data,” Michelle says. ”Machine learning, plus the computing power we have today, is pushing our capabilities beyond what we would have thought possible.” NLP Specialist:NLP Specialists serve more of a niche role, working primarily with text and AI to teach computers how to understand and interact with humans. They typically work with programming languages like Python andJava, and their responsibilities might include cleaning and formatting unstructured data and building chatbots. “If you want to learn about language and apply text to machine learning without getting too deep into the math behind it, NLP is the place to begin,” Michelle says. Distinct from (yet similar to) Machine Learning Specialists,Machine Learning Engineersbuild machine learning systems and applications like facial and speech recognition software. They apply machine learning to streaming data at both input and output, and they primarily rely on Python and its machine learning libraries likepandasandscikit-learn. They also often work withbig data, and they’re in high demand with organizations that sell consumer goods that require recommender systems (like TV streaming or e-commerce websites). In fact, recommender systems are becoming more popular, and they can be a valuable tool for many of the roles included in this list. Beyond providing users with personalized suggestions, they also help businesses learn more about their customers, and they’re used by companies like Spotify, Netflix, Uber, and Google. Check out ourBuild a Recommender System skill pathto learn how to build one from scratch. (And if you want to skip the basics and start building right away, tryLearn Recommender Systems.) The main difference between Machine Learning Specialists and Machine Learning Engineers is that Machine Learning Specialists use machine learning to better understand their data, and Machine Learning Engineers turn machine learning models into products that end users can engage with. Take Netflix as an example. The preview images used for different shows are based on a cohort analysis, which are performed by Machine Learning Specialists. The recommendation engine that suggests things you might like is created by Machine Learning Engineers. Business Intelligence (B.I.) Analysts are more focused on practical outcomes than other data science roles, and their primary duties include answering business questions and delivering business-advancing insights to stakeholders. To do so, they need a deep understanding of their industries and departments. Michelle describes the role as “part domain knowledge and part technical knowledge.” B.I. Analysts typically don’t need as much programming experience as other data science roles. They still use SQL, but their insights are shared with B.I. tools like Microsoft Excel (which you can learn how to use in ourAnalyze Data with Microsoft Excel course) and Tableau. According to Michelle, this is the fastest route to a career in data science. “You don’t have to go deep into statistics or machine learning, you just need to understand the basics of how data and databases work and those two B.I. tools,” she says. “With that, you can start making a huge contribution to an organization because it allows you to ask and answer questions with data.” Want to become a B.I. Analyst? Check out ourBusiness Intelligence Data Analyst career path. Most Data Scientist job postings don’t distinguish between specializations. So it’s important to read the job description carefully. Michelle recommends making a list of companies you want to work for and reading through their Data Scientist roles to get a sense of what they’re looking for. Here are some clues and keywords to look for: Keep in mind that the line between Data Analysts and Data Scientists is very blurry, Michelle notes. The titles are often used interchangeably in job postings, so unless you’re pursuing NLP or machine learning roles, look for Data Analyst jobs as well. Ready to become a Data Scientist? We’re here to guide you along every step of the way. Our Data Scientist career paths will teach you the foundations of data science and the skills and knowledge you’ll need for your specialization.

The data scientist career path involves progressing from entry-level analyst roles, gaining more responsibility and leadership roles as you rise through the ranks.Data scientistsuse a mix ofdata analyticsand business intelligence to drive smarter business decisions and solve complex problems. Eventually, a data scientist may need to choose between focusing on the data and technical side or the business side. Progressing through a data scientist career, you typically have two routes you can take. “You either deliver more and more technically as well as mentoring the staff and reviewing their deliverables,” says Xena Ugrinsky, CTO and co-founder of Pilot Wave Holdings Management. “Or you go the more business-focused route — managing the projects end to end, becoming the liaison to the business team.” Data scienceexists at the intersection of technology and business, so it makes sense that higher-level roles may require focusing on one side more than the other. But data science and the job titledata scientistare umbrella terms. The career path to a data scientist role often involves starting in an entry-level position, with the job title data scientist or analyst, and carrying that title throughout your career with different levels (e.g., I, II, III) or amendments (e.g., junior, senior, lead, managing) added. However, you can also hold a variety of job titles throughout your career while still doing the job of a data scientist. For instance, you could start your career as adata analyst, progress to the title of data scientist, and then become a director of data science and, eventually, a chief information officer (CIO). Learn the in-demand data science skills employers are looking for with this free job simulation from BCG. Avg. Time:6 to 7 hours Skills you’ll build:Business understanding, hypothesis framing, communication, programming, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, creativity, mathematical modelling There are also ways to specialize throughout a data science career by focusing on one area, and having a specialization can be a great advantage. “Become an expert in a specific domain or industry, such asfinance,health care, ormarketing,” says Vanja Djuric, associate professor of analytics at the University of Akron. “This can help you gain visibility and recognition for your contributions.” Regardless of your level of seniority, specialization, or job title, there’s one step you can take that will always help you progress through your career: “Show the impact of your work by quantifying the results of your projects and presenting them to stakeholders,” says Djuric. Not only will this give you visibility across your team, but it will also show your value to the company and can give you leverage when it comes to making transitions, landing promotions, or seeking new employment. Explore the power of data and its ability to power breakthrough possibilities for individuals, organisations and societies with this free job simulation from Quantium. Avg. Time:4 to 5 hours Skills you’ll build:Data validation, data visualisation, data wrangling, programming, data analysis, commercial thinking, statistical testing, presentation skills Typical job titles:junior data scientist, junior data analyst, data scientist, data analyst, analyst, data analyst I, data scientist I, business analyst, business intelligence analyst Entry-level roles as a data scientist usually involve executing tasks delegated by senior and lead scientists. The goal in these roles is to learn, explore areas of interest, and solidify youranalytical skills. This is also the time to grow your technical skills in languages like R and Python. Soft skillsare especially important in entry-level positions. Ultimately, many of the daily duties of a data scientist arehard skillsthat can be taught along the way. It is vital to show you can work within a team, be willing to learn,listen actively, andcommunicateeffectively. These skills are invaluable for career progression. “Promotion criteria for most junior data scientist positions are a high degree of ownership, independent thinking, and the impact your work has brought to the business unit you are working with,” says Dushyant Sengar, director of data science at BDO USA. Jumpstart your career in data with our picks for the best data job simulations. Typical job titles:data scientist, senior data scientist, data architect,data engineer, data mining engineer, senior business analyst, Mid-level data scientist positions may involve many of the same duties or responsibilities as entry-level roles, with an added layer of seniority and ownership. “There are overlaps to entry-level labels,” says Ugrinsky, “but usually just with the word manager [or senior] added.” In mid-level positions, you are expected to have a stronger understanding of how the business can use data to overcome obstacles and the ability to take a problem and determine the right approach to solving it. By this point in your career, your role may involve “​​working without supervision, managing a team, reviewing team output and being responsible for their quality, participating in higher level strategy decisions, and solution design,” says Ugrinsky. You also should have enough experience to know whether you prefer the technical or business side of data science. If you prefer the technical side, you can begin shifting into engineering or architecture roles. To do this, you must show a strong understanding of coding, building Extract, Transform, Lead (ETL) pipelines, and planning data storage structures. Many certificates or bootcamps can help you learn, enhance, and prove your skills. >>MORE:Are coding bootcamps worth it? To focus more on the business side, you need to show you understand how the business works, how data plays into business decisions, and how the company acts as part of the larger economy. Pursuing a master of business administration (MBA) degree or a specialized certificate can help show your business acumen. Promotion into senior-level data scientist positions requires “developing technical skills to a high level of expertise, taking on challenging projects and demonstrating leadership potential,” says Ugrinsky. Typical job titles:lead data scientist, principal data scientist, director of data science, vice president of data science, chief data scientist, chief information officer, chief technology officer, chief operations officer In senior data scientist positions, you must have a high level of ownership and a track record of managing crises and leading projects. You also need to show you can hire and build a competent team of data scientists, analysts, and engineers. Additionally, senior-level data scientists often need to work alongside C-suite executives and other business leaders, so they need to bridge the gaps between the technical, analytical, and business aspects of data science, communicating findings clearly to stakeholders. “Coaching and mentoring junior or mid-level data scientists to navigate day-to-day project problems or long-term career options is another set of responsibilities they need to take care of,” adds Sengar. At this point in a data scientist’s career, they have proven themselves adaptable, flexible, and knowledgeable, with strongleadership skills. These attributes can eventually lead data scientists to become C-suite executives themselves, like chief technology officers (CTOs), chief information officers (CIOs), and chief operations officers (COOs). Discover if this is the right career path for you with a free Forage data job simulation. You typically need at least a bachelor’s degree to qualify for entry-level data scientist positions. Most employers look for degrees in analytical or quantitative disciplines like math,economics, statistics,computer science, information technology, orfinance. When looking to progress into higher-level roles, Djuric recommends students “pursue additional education or certification programs that can enhance your skills and knowledge in data science, such as a Master’s degree in data science or a certification inmachine learning.” An MBA, too, can be a great way to boost yourresumeand help you move into more senior positions. Additionally, while an MBA can give you an in-road to focusing on the business side of data science, your undergraduate degree major can also give you a way to specialize early. “Having industry-specific knowledge or experience can be beneficial, particularly for data scientists working in regulated industries such as health care or finance,” says Djuric. So, if you’re passionate about data science and medicine, there are ways to set yourself up for that career path during college. Professional certificates and coding bootcamps are excellent options for growing specific skill sets and boosting your data science career, regardless of your background. For example, if your degree is in business, but you want to transition into data engineering roles, taking a bootcamp in coding can be a great place to start building those skills. >>MORE:See our picks forthe best online coding bootcampsandfree coding bootcampsfor 2024. Early-career certifications that can help you land entry-level roles or establish credibility early in your career include: These certifications and certificates are suitable for those with little to no experience in data science who are looking for ways to hone their skills. For those with experience (5+ years) as a data scientist, certifications are available to prove a higher degree of knowledge, skill, and technological ability. Some advanced certifications in data science include: These lists are far from exhaustive. However, remember to look for certifications only from reputable companies and institutions.

Time:3 to 4 hours Skills you’ll build:Web scraping, data manipulation, PowerPoint, Python, machine learning, data science, data visualisation “The importance of communication andpresentation skills, also known as storytelling, cannot be stressed enough,” says Sengar. Analyzing data is one thing, but using that data effectively and telling a story with it is a key skill for data scientists. Additionally, because data science is an interdisciplinary field involving many players and departments, data scientists need to “work effectively with cross-functional teams and stakeholders, such as data engineers, business analysts, and executives,” says Djuric. Other vital interpersonal and soft skills for data scientists include: However, data scientists also need a plethora of technical or hard skills, such as: Fiddling around in Excel sheets just doesn’t suit a digital jedi. Move from zero to digital hero with this free job simulation from PwC. Avg. Time:5 to 6 hours Skills you’ll build:Defining KPIs, Power BI, calculating measures, insight and actions Regardless of location, experience, background, or specialization, data scientists make amedian annual salary of $103,500, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Similarly, across all levels and industries, wages reported on Glassdoor show an estimatedsalary range of $131,000 to $189,000per year, including bonuses, stock sharing, profit sharing, and commission. A data scientist’s salary may change drastically depending on how much experience they have, though. What if you don’t spend your career with just a data scientist job title, though? The principle stays the same — more seniority means more pay — but the upper end of the scale is much higher than for those with the title ofdata scientistalone. For example, someone’s career could progress like this: Certain cities, like San Francisco and Seattle, may offer higher pay, too. Additionally,big tech companiesand banks often have higher salaries since they rely heavily on data science and need top-notch scientists and analysts. Take this free quiz to find out what career is right for you! The BLS predicts that the employment of data scientists isexpected to grow 35%between 2022 and 2032, which is a significantly faster growth rate than the average across all occupations. Even as data scientists become more in demand, it’s crucial to remember that “data science is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important to stay up to date with the latest tools, techniques, and trends,” says Djuric. To stay ahead of the curve, successful data scientists should expect to continually learn and explore new and emerging technologies. Additionally, because data science exists in both the tech and business spaces, there are some ways that machine learning systems andartificial intelligence(AI) will create paths for non-data scientists to assume data science roles. “The easier the tools become as a facilitation for data cleansing, analysis, machine learning and visualization, the more opportunity there will be for non-data scientists to occupy these roles,” says Ugrinsky. This means that there could be more room in the future for professionals with very different backgrounds and skill sets to work in data science. New career paths into and out of data science roles may develop as the data and business landscapes shift.

https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/blog/data-scientist-career-path/,"Nearly every type of organization — from government, to retail, to healthcare — needs data scientists. Data scientists organize and analyze raw data from various sources, enabling these enterprises to make informed decisions to ensure efficiency, boost profitability, and fuel growth. Demand for data science professionals is expected to increase significantly in the next decade. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates22 percent growth through 2030, which far exceeds the7.7 percent projected increasefor all occupations. That translates to a need for an average of 3,200 data scientists each year through 2030.  These positions (which according to the BLSearn a mean annual salary of $103,930) tend to be clustered in Maryland and Virginia, as data scientists are in high demand with the federal government. Data scientists are also in high demand in New York, California, Texas, and Washington state. The demand for data scientists coincides with a marked increase in the sheer amount of available data. According to Statista, justtwo zettabytes of data (i.e., two trillion gigabytes) were created, copied, captured, or consumed in 2010, a number that is expected to increase to 79 zettabytes by the end of 2021, and then mushroom to 181 zettabytes by 2025. These data increases are prompting organizations to seek highly skilled data professionals as they pivot toward data-driven decision making. For example, 92 percent of the executives responding to the 2019 MIT Sloan Management Reviewsaid they had begun investing more heavily in data and AI. That same year, Entrepreneur reported that companies that leveraged big data were8 percent more profitablethan those that did not. Clearly, data scientists have a vital role — one that will only continue to increase in importance and value over time. CareerOneStop indicates that37 percent of data scientists have obtained their bachelor’s degree, usually in a field such as statistics, computer science, information technologies, mathematics, or data science. In addition, 35 percent of data scientists hold a master’s degree, and 14 percent have attained a doctoral degree. Yet, some believe that a degree is not as crucial to career success as gaining early proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and R, which can provide significant benefit in the long run. Carlos Melendez, COO and Co-Founder of the artificial intelligence and software development company Wovenware, stressed inan October 2021 Forbes piece that education should begin as early as elementary school: “Every student, regardless of their occupation, will need to be data-literate to succeed in a world where data will increasingly be king.” A data analytics boot camp will teach you the skills to pursue an entry-level data science role and to enter this exciting career. Such boot camps are short-term, intensive courses lasting three to six months and offer flexible scheduling, online coursework, and practical training. To learn all these skills and more, check outColumbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp, as it can serve as your gateway to an exciting, fulfilling career. Again, a solid foundation is essential, andColumbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Campcan help you learn theskills needed to become a data analyst. These skills include learning Python, Java, R, MATLAB, and NoSQL. Additional in-demand skills include Data visualization uses maps or graphs to give data visual context. LinkedIn Senior Content Marketing Manager Paul Petronehas likened it to “telling stories with insights gleaned from the data.” Data cleaning is the process of removing data that is incorrect, redundant, corrupted, incomplete, or incorrectly formatted. Machine learninguses algorithms to discern patternsin data sets and powers search engines, social media platforms, voice assistants, and the recommendation systems used by content providers. Linear algebra/calculus are advanced math skills that are crucial for those in data science. Linear algebra has been called “the mathematics of data,” in that it has applications to machine and deep learning, and calculus is no less crucial in building algorithms. Microsoft Excel, while not as sophisticated a skill as others listed here, remains important given its widespread popularity and usage within the field of data. Soft skills like critical thinking and communication are also taught in data bootcamps. Melendez notes the importance of such skills in his most recent Forbes piece, as well as an earlier article published in July 2021.He lists empathy, teamwork, open-mindedness, and a business mindsetas important soft skills, indicating that problem-solving has also become a vital skill as the pandemic has worn on and “the neat and orderly world of data scientists was turned upside down.” Melendez’s point is that the data informing predictive algorithms may no longer be reliable at present. He offered an example illustrating the recent spike in visits to doctors’ offices, as COVID-19 began to wane in certain areas and patients could move about more freely. While such an uptick would normally suggest that customers are poised to change carriers, it is more realistically due to the fact so many people put off doctors’ appointments due to lockdowns or fear of exposure to the virus. As you can see, understanding the various causes behind consumer behaviors is crucial to being able to glean relevant insights from collected data. In other words, a data scientist must consider data context and additional variables while also applying analytic best practices and common sense. While there aremany different roles in the data science field(including software engineers, business analysts, etc.), the focus here will be on the data science career path. As youlearn how to become a data analyst, sometimes referred to as a junior data scientist, you will need a strong skill foundation to be successful. Applicable skills may include a proper math background, aptitude in data visualization and data cleaning, and familiarity with different programming languages. Junior data scientists work on the more basic aspects of data analysis, including extracting, cleaning, integrating, and loading data. Focused mainly on predictive analysis, they often use pre-existing statistical models or work with specifications laid out by a more senior data scientist. Those entering the data science field usually remain junior data scientists for a year or two before becoming mid-level data scientists. Mid-level data scientists enjoy greater autonomy with less frequent check-ins, and are expected to know how to perform exploratory data analysis and build the necessary statistical models for problem-solving. In addition, mid-level data scientists may have the opportunity to work with senior data scientists in more advanced areas of machine learning and AI. Individuals three to seven years into their data careers may qualify for a promotion to senior data scientists. While mid-level data scientists construct the statistical models that will solve problems, senior data scientists put that model to use in conjunction with other advanced tools. Moreover, senior data scientists are responsible for monitoring and fine-tuning an organization’s methodologies, while collaborating with key stakeholders and communicating the organization’s data insights to customers and company leaders. Senior data scientists are also responsible for mentoring junior data scientists. Data science managers are responsible for the big picture — hiring the right people, establishing high standards, setting worthwhile goals, and understanding which KPIs are appropriate for the team. As with managers in other sectors, the idea is to create a productive work environment while maintaining flexibility as products and industries continually evolve. A data science manager should be cognizant of new developments and prepare their team accordingly, as that will ensure their organization remains competitive. Data science managers typically haveat least five years of previous experience as data scientists, and many disciplines require one to three years of prior supervisory experience as well. Data science job growth is occurring across a variety of industries every year. In fact, CareerOneStop is bullish on the future of data science, predicting a 31 percent increase in data science roles annually through the next decade. And, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the top three states employing the most data scientists are California, Texas, and New York (respectively) withNew York City being the top metropolitan area for data scientist employmentin the U.S. While demand for data scientists is extremely high in these areas, these professionals are in high demand across the country and the globe. Through the explosive growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) — i.e., wearable tech, smart home devices, baby monitors, etc. — more granular data will be generated to inform decision-making and provide additional insights. Moreover, with the ongoing rollout of 5G and its impact on data flow, as well as the potential of 6G bringing the advent of the “Internet of Everything,” the need for data scientists will only continue to increase. Consider the potential impact in the following sectors: Transportation:Data is critical to the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) because transportation-related information may soon be processed by vehicles rather than humans. Because AVs are such advanced forms of artificial intelligence (AI), they will require an exponential amount of data to function. If the technology reaches its full potential, one of the biggest benefits will be safer roads. Data scientist Stefano Cosentino was hired by the German engineering firm Bosch in 2017 as part of the team developing autonomous vehicles. While he was uncertain of his role at first, over the next two years it evolved to the point where he was leading a 10-person team that contributed to the development of such vehicles by providing on-demand data analyses. In addition, Cosentino wrote on the website Towards Data Science: “We have developed rule-based and probabilistic root cause analysis solutions to support the forensic team. We have created a feature bank that is enabling various ML projects. One is scenario identification, which we use for KPI estimation, verification and validation, as well as issue tracking. Another use of the feature bank is for anomaly detection.” Healthcare:Some 30 percent of the world’s data is created by the healthcare field, and by 2025 it is expected to increase to 36 percent. Too often, however, this information is siloed, making it inaccessible to all who need it during a patient’s care journey. This issue — interoperability, or the ability of systems or organizations to share data — is an ongoing challenge, and one data scientists can help solve. This can be done by culling data from various sources (electronic health records, genomics, imaging, etc.) and analyzing it, thereby providing clinicians with insights that will enable them to personalize care. Finance:So much of the finance field involves interpreting real-time data and forecasting future trends or market events. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming increasingly essential to those processes, and data scientists use those tools to analyze and manage risk, leading to better decision-making and greater profitability. Supply chain management:The global supply chain was already undergoing a digital transformation before the pandemic hit, but the outbreak of COVID-19 accelerated that trend; making the need for advanced technologies like AI, blockchain, and robotics more pronounced. Data scientists in this sector use predictive analytics to make the supply chain more agile and efficient. This includes anticipating demand, determining where inventory should be positioned proactively to avoid out-of-stock events, determining the optimal network of manufacturers and storage facilities, and developing optimized routes for transporting inventory. Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp, based in New York City, offers learners the opportunity to gain in-demand data science skills via practical, real-world scenarios and professional instruction with flexible scheduling. Another appealing aspect of a data science career is the compensation. The mean annual salary for a data scientist in the U.S. is$103,930, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And, according to the BLS, the states with the highest mean annual salary were California ($129,060), New York ($124,240), and Washington ($118,320). The business sectors reporting the highest annual salary for data scientists include computer/peripheral equipment ($144,090), finance ($143,490), and merchant wholesalers ($142,300).
